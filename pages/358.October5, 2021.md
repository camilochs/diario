- I'm working on beam search implementation to solve the LCS problem.
- This is my PhD project, the idea is found an integration of machine learning techniques into metaheuristic algorithms.
- English practice:
	- My name is Camilo, I'm Christian new PhD Student.
	- I'm working on integration machine learning methods into metaheuristic algorithms.
- Working day
	- The beam search is a classical tree search method that was introduced in the context of scheduling.
	- I'm coding in Julia because it's outperform is similar to C++.
