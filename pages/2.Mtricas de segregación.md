# Métricas de segregación

- <cite>The clustering coefficient #[[Coeficiente de grupo]] is a measure of how much nodes cluster together. It is defined as the fraction of triangles (complete subgraph of three nodes and three edges) around a node and is equivalent to the fraction of the node's neighbors that are neighbors of each other. </cite>
- <cite> A common variant of the clustering coefficient is known as transitivity #Transitividad. This can simply be defined as the ratio between the observed number of closed triplets (complete subgraph with three nodes and two edges) and the maximum possible number of closed triplets in the graph. </cite>
- [[Modularidad]] <cite> was designed to quantify the division of a network in aggregated sets of highly interconnected nodes, commonly known as modules, communities, groups, or clusters. The main idea is that networks having high modularity will show dense connections within the module and sparse connections between modules.</cite>
